- Real-time score tracking

### 🌟 3D Pong (Babylon.js)  
- Immersive 3D environment
- Advanced physics and lighting
- 3D camera controls
- Modern graphics rendering

## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Canvas API**: 2D game rendering
- **Babylon.js**: 3D graphics engine  
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication
- **CSS3**: Modern styling

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Fastify**: High-performance web framework
- **SQLite**: Embedded database
- **JWT**: Secure authentication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time features

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration
- **nginx**: Web server and reverse proxy
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS encryption

## 📚 Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Check installation:
```bash
make install  # Automatically checks prerequisites
```

### Production Mode

Perfect for deployment and testing the final application:

```bash
# Build and start production environment
make up
# Or manually: docker-compose up --build -d

# Visit https://localhost:8080
# Note: Accept the SSL certificate warning (self-signed certificate)

# Stop the application
make down
# Or manually: docker-compose down
```

### Development Mode  

Ideal for active development with hot reload:

```bash
# Start development environment
make dev
# Or manually: docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d

# View logs in real-time
make dev-logs

# Stop development environment  
make dev-down
```

**Development Features:**
- 🔥 Hot reload for TypeScript changes
- 📋 Real-time log monitoring  
- 🐚 Easy container shell access
- 🗄️ Database inspection tools

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### View Application Status
```bash
make status           # Show all container status
make logs            # Production logs
make dev-logs        # Development logs
```

### Access Container Shells
```bash
make shell-backend   # Backend container shell
make shell-frontend  # Frontend container shell
```

### Database Access
```bash
make db             # Connect to SQLite database
```

Inside the database shell:
```sql
-- View all users
SELECT id, username, created_at FROM users;

-- View user with specific username
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

## 🧹 Cleanup & Maintenance

```bash
make clean          # Remove all containers, images, and volumes
make clean-containers  # Remove containers only
make clean-images   # Remove images only  
make reset          # Full reset (clean + install)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Basic Connectivity Tests
```bash
make test           # Test HTTPS and HTTP connections
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Registration**: Create a new user account
2. **Authentication**: Test login/logout functionality
3. **2D Game**: Play classic Pong game
4. **3D Game**: Experience 3D Pong with Babylon.js
5. **Profile**: Update user profile and avatar
6. **Tournament**: Create and join tournaments

## 🔒 Security Features

- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Google OAuth**: Third-party authentication integration
- **2FA Support**: Two-factor authentication for enhanced security
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage with bcrypt
- **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
make down           # Stop any running containers
make clean-containers  # Clean up orphaned containers
```

**SSL Certificate Warnings**
- This is expected with self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" in your browser

**Docker Permission Issues**
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d  # Run with sudo if needed
```

**Database Locked**
```bash
make down           # Stop containers to release database lock
make up             # Restart
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Status**: `make status`
2. **View Logs**: `make logs` or `make dev-logs`  
3. **Full Reset**: `make reset`
4. **Manual Commands**: Use Docker commands directly if make fails
